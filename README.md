# Case 1: Landing Page
 
Recreating a Adobe XD mockup into a webpage.

Landing page created with responsivity for mobile.

Reflection:
- learn and deepen on JavaScript (!!)
- finetune responsiveness of the page, mind the details.
- work on image src sets, how to implement and correctly use (helps with the resposiveness)
- keep an eye out for accessibilty (ARIA etc.)
- deepen/explore further grid and flexbox implementations
